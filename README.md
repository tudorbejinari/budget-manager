# JavaScript/jQuery [Budget Manager](https://tudorbejinari.github.io/budget-manager/)

Starter code for DU Coding Boot Camp JavaScript/jQuery Review Session.

## Getting Started

Begin by forking and cloning this repository.

During the session, we'll be working together to add functionality to create new budget items, render budget items, sort by category, show total amount spent, delete budget items, etc. This app will use localStorage for data persistence.
